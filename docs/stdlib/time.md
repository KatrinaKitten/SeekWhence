## Time Breakdown Functions

This module contains two namespaces, `utc` and `local`, for working with UTC and local time respectively. The following functions are available as children of each namespace. Manually selected timezones are currently not supported.

All functions expect the Unix time in milliseconds as a parameter, which can be retrieved with the builtin `[systime]` function.

| Name | Arguments | Description |
| :--- | :-------- | :---------- |
| `year` | `t` Unix time | The full year (e.g. 1993). |
| `month` | `t` Unix time | The month as a number (0-11). |
| `day` | `t` Unix time | The day of the month as a number (1-31). |
| `weekday` | `t` Unix time | The day of the week as a number (0-6). |
| `yearday` | `t` Unix time | The day of the year as a number (1-366). |
| `hour` | `t` Unix time | The hour as a number (0-23). |
| `minute` | `t` Unix time | The minute as a number (0-59). |
| `second` | `t` Unix time | The second as a number (0-61). |
| `isDST` | `t` Unix time | `true` if currently in Daylight Savings Time.<br>`none` if DST status can't be determined. |
